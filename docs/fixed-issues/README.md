# Fixed Issues

A log of defects that actually shipped (or were caught mid-session before
shipping) and how they were fixed - the resolved counterpart to
[../known-issues.md](../known-issues.md), which tracks the opposite: issues
found and deliberately left unfixed. Fuller "what was being built when this
was found" narrative lives in
[../phase-2/progress/README.md](../phase-2/progress/README.md); each entry
below is self-contained enough to read on its own, focused on what broke,
why, and how it was confirmed fixed.
