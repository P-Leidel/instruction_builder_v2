Recorded 2026-09-13, after discussing three possible future features before
implementing the token-connector-lines feature (see
[phase-2/progress/tasks-05-12-early-build.md](./phase-2/progress/tasks-05-12-early-build.md)). None of these are
built. This doc exists so a later decision can be checked against them -
**if a future change would conflict with or foreclose one of these, say so
before making it**, rather than silently making it harder to build later.

## 1. Warnings rendered inside their related token — ✅ Implemented 2026-09-13

Built, generalized beyond the original idea: Quantity and Warning (and a
new Time category) all moved out of "Add to step" into a separate "Add to
token" menu, and render as small corner badges on the token they're
attached to rather than as their own chip. See
[phase-2/progress/tasks-05-12-early-build.md](./phase-2/progress/tasks-05-12-early-build.md) for what shipped -
`InstructionToken.quantity`/`warning`/`time` (`TokenAttachment`, at most
one of each per token) is the "attached-to" relationship this item said
would be needed, and it turned out not to require any special-casing in
drag hit-testing or the connector lines, since an attachment was never a
chip, drop zone, or line endpoint to begin with - only ever a badge drawn
inside its parent token's existing chip.

## 2. Radial "steps point to a center goal" canvas

An alternative layout where every step arranges around a central goal node
instead of stacking vertically.

- **Why not now:** no concrete need yet, just a possibility raised.
- **What it needs:** a new/parallel canvas renderer (different geometry,
  hit-testing, and line-routing) reusing the existing document/selection/
  drag state. The document model itself needs no changes - it stores no
  position/layout data, only an ordered step/token list - so this is a
  rendering-layer addition, not a data migration.
- **Watch for:** any future code outside `InstructionCanvas` (e.g. the
  export pipeline, tasks 15-17) that assumes there is exactly one canvas
  layout shape, rather than treating layout as a pluggable renderer over
  the same document.
- **Update 2026-09-13 (raised):** exactly this was confirmed by an external
  architecture audit - about 250 of `InstructionCanvas.tsx`'s 591 lines were
  pure, unexported geometry functions (`chipPosition`, `stepHeight`,
  `widestRowWidth`, `buildConnectors`, `insertionMarkerPosition`), and the
  drag hit-test already recovers that same geometry back out of the DOM via
  `elementFromPoint` + `data-step-id`/`data-token-index`
  (`lib/pointer-drag.ts`) instead of querying it directly. See
  [known-issues.md](./known-issues.md) for the fuller audit context.
- **Update 2026-09-13 (done, as part of Task 15):** the geometry now lives
  in `lib/canvas-layout.ts` - `computeCanvasLayout(steps, isDesktop)` is the
  one entry point, document + a desktop/mobile flag in, positioned layout
  out - and `InstructionCanvas` only renders what it returns. This is a real
  step toward "layout as a pluggable renderer": a radial layout could now be
  a second module with the same `computeCanvasLayout` shape, without
  touching `InstructionCanvas`'s render logic. Two things from the "after"
  picture are **not** done, on purpose (scope boundary agreed before
  starting Task 15): the drag hit-test still queries the DOM
  (`elementFromPoint` + `data-*`) rather than the layout module directly,
  and SVG export (`lib/svg-export.ts`) works by serializing the real
  rendered DOM of a hidden read-only canvas (with computed styles baked in -
  see [fixed-issues/svg-export-unstyled-shapes.md](./fixed-issues/svg-export-unstyled-shapes.md)) rather than an independent
  renderer reading `CanvasLayout` data directly - so a genuinely different
  layout (like this radial idea) would still need its own rendering path,
  just not its own geometry math. Revisit both if a second layout or a
  hit-test bug ever makes the DOM round-trip actually cost something.
- **Update 2026-09-20 (first half done):** the drag hit-test no longer
  queries the DOM. `resolveDropTarget(point, layout)` in
  `lib/canvas-layout.ts` resolves a drop purely against the same
  `CanvasLayout` the canvas was rendered from, and the drag path is down to
  two DOM reads per resolution, both on elements already in hand: one
  `getScreenCTM()` to convert the pointer's client coordinates into design
  units, and one rect read to reject points the canvas is clipped away from
  (a matrix maps happily onto canvas the card is clipping out of sight).
  What a second layout inherits is narrower than "working drag for free",
  though, and the distinction matters for exactly this item:
  `resolveDropTarget` finds a step by testing the point against each card's
  vertical band and bounds x to the canvas padding, so the vertical-stack
  geometry is written into the resolver itself. A radial layout would still
  need its own. What it does inherit is the *seam* - one pure
  `(point, layout)` call resolved against the same layout value the canvas
  rendered, with the DOM round-trip and the `data-*` attribute contract
  gone from the drag path for good - which is the part the "after" picture
  assumed and the code did not deliver until now. See
  [phase-3/progress/architecture-2026-09-20-layout-hit-testing.md](./phase-3/progress/architecture-2026-09-20-layout-hit-testing.md).
  The SVG-export half is unchanged: it still serializes a rendered hidden
  canvas, so a genuinely different layout would still need its own
  rendering path.

## 3. Per-connection line style, or labeling a line as an action

Letting the user pick a line's style (solid/dashed/arrow) per connection,
or attach a text label to one specific line.

- **Why not now:** the connector-lines feature being built now derives
  every line purely from token array order - no connection has its own
  identity or stored data.
- **What it needs:** a schema-additive field holding per-connection
  metadata (e.g. keyed by the pair of token ids it connects), plus UI to
  select/edit it. Low-risk to add later - the model's schema-versioning
  strategy (docs/phase-1/architecture.md section 2.3) is built for exactly
  this: an old saved document simply won't have the field, and gets
  default behavior.
- **Watch for:** the connector-line rendering code drifting somewhere that
  has no natural per-pair lookup point (e.g. a single hardcoded style
  constant with no per-index branch) - keep it simple, but keep it a loop
  over pairs, not a single flat style applied all at once.

## Assessment as of this writing

None of the three require a change before implementing the connector-lines
feature described in phase-2/progress/tasks-05-12-early-build.md -
it's scoped in a way that
doesn't foreclose any of them (see "Watch for" above per item). No action
suggested right now.
