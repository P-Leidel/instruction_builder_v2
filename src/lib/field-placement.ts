/**
 * Where a field popover sits relative to the trigger button that opened it
 * - see `components/FieldPopover/FieldPopover.tsx` for the panel itself and
 * `CONTEXT.md` for what a field popover is.
 *
 * Extracted from inside FieldPopover's own effect by the 2026-09-18
 * architecture review (findings 6 and 8). The reason is testability, not
 * reuse: FieldPopover is the only caller and is expected to stay the only
 * caller, so this is a hypothetical seam by the usual "one adapter means a
 * hypothetical seam, two means a real one" test. What justifies it is that
 * the arithmetic was previously unreachable from any test this repo can
 * run - `vitest.config.ts` is `environment: "node"` and matches only
 * `*.test.ts`, so nothing under `src/components/` is testable at all
 * without adding a DOM test environment, which this project has weighed
 * and declined on its own merits (see
 * `docs/adr/0003-no-component-test-environment.md`). Placement is the part of that
 * panel most likely to be wrong on a device nobody here owns, so it is the
 * part worth being able to test on a machine with no browser. Please don't
 * inline it back for want of a second caller.
 *
 * Takes plain numbers rather than `DOMRect`/`Window` for the same reason:
 * a test constructs an input with object literals and no DOM whatsoever.
 * The caller does all the measuring.

 * The ~6.4px (0.4rem) gap CSS leaves between trigger and panel is

 * past the left edge after flipping, so an additional offset clamps its
 * position to the viewport gutter. CSS bounds the panel's width to fit.
 *
 * Vertically, the panel flips above only when it does not fit below *and*
 * genuinely does fit above. When neither side fits, it stays below: a
 * panel overflowing the bottom can still be scrolled to, while one
