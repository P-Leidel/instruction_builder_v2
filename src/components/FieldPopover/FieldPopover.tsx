/**
 * A small non-modal floating panel anchored to a trigger button - used by
 * DurationField (Step/Token time) and TokenDetails' QuantityRow (Quantity)
 * to edit a value without affecting the layout around the trigger (see
 * docs/phase-3/progress - the row those two used to share reflowed
 * unexpectedly whenever one's inline edit form opened, since both lived in
 * the same wrapping flex row; this popover removes the form from that flow
 * entirely instead of trying to reserve space for it).
 *
 * Must be rendered inside a `position: relative` wrapper around exactly the
 * trigger button `anchorRef` points at (see `.field-popover-anchor` in
 * global.css) - the default `top: 100%` positions it directly under that
 * button, not the field's label or any other sibling content.
 *
 * CSS owns the actual position; this only chooses between the four
 * possibilities by toggling `.field-popover--right`/`--above`, from
 * `resolveFieldPlacement` in `lib/field-placement.ts` (which is where the
 * viewport arithmetic and its tests live), with a horizontal correction
 * when neither edge alignment fits inside the window. Placement runs in a
 * `useLayoutEffect` rather than `useEffect` so it happens before paint -
 * with `useEffect` the panel is drawn below-left for one frame and then
 * visibly snaps, which is worse now there is a vertical flip to snap
 * through. It re-runs on `resize` and `orientationchange`: rotating a
 * tablet with the panel open used to leave it wherever it was first
 * placed, and that is a case task 30's tablet testers are asked about by
 * name (docs/manual-testing-checklist.md).
 *
 * Genuinely non-modal, and now says so consistently. It used to declare
 * `aria-modal="false"` while cycling Tab back to its first control - a
 * screen reader user was told they could leave and then prevented from
 * doing so (2026-09-18 architecture review, finding 8). There is no
 * backdrop and nothing is made inert, so the honest fix was dropping the
 * trap, not adding modal machinery to a panel whose whole purpose is to be
 * unobtrusive. Escape and an outside pointerdown still close it.
 *
 * Because focus can now leave, returning it to the trigger on close is
 * conditional: yanking focus backwards out of wherever a user has since
 * tabbed to would be its own bug. `document.activeElement` is unreliable
 * by the time this effect's cleanup runs (it may already have reset to
 * `<body>`), so focus is tracked as it moves instead.
