 * hand-roll this identical add/display/edit/remove/popover-anchor structure
 * around their own, genuinely different, edit forms (four d/h/m/s inputs vs.

   *
   * The considered alternative was deleting the uncontrolled mode outright
   * - make `editing`/`onEditingChange` required, and give StepDetails (the
   * only caller relying on self-managed state) its own `useState`. That
   * removes this whole class of bug instead of guarding against it, at the
   * cost of pushing state into a caller with no other reason to hold it.
   * Declined, with the reasoning and the revisit trigger recorded in
   * docs/adr/0001-keep-collapsedfield-dual-mode.md rather than only here.
